<!-- 
If classes in the p or div are multiple; then the latest mentioned element in the style sheet is taken in case of override

suppose <p class="BigFont red">Text </p> is the line of the code.
Here, classes mentioned are BigFont and red. In css style sheet, red is mentioned first and then BigFont. 
Hence in case of color override, BigFont is comsidered i.e., Azure
